A modern, high-performance personal portfolio website designed to showcase my experience as a **Senior Software Engineer** specializing in Angular, AWS, and Microservices.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: Glassmorphism
This project utilizes **Glassmorphism** (frosted glass aesthetic) to create a modern, depth-based UI.
* **Pure CSS:** No external CSS frameworks (Bootstrap/Tailwind) were used, ensuring maximum performance and lightweight load times.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Uses translucency and blur (`backdrop-filter`) to establish hierarchy between the background and content cards.
* **Responsiveness:** Fully responsive grid layout that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom variables (`:root`), Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Media Queries.
* **Hosting:** Compatible with GitHub Pages or AWS S3 Static Hosting.
